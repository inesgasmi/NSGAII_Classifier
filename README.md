Project Name: NSGAII Classifier

Description:
The NSGAII Classifier is a Python project that implements the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for rule-based classification. It generates classification rules using the NSGA-II algorithm and evaluates them on a given dataset. The project includes modules for rule generation, evaluation, and visualization.

Key Features:

Rule generation using NSGA-II algorithm
Evaluation of generated rules based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Visualization of evaluation metrics distribution
Rule export to a text file
Dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the main.py script to generate and evaluate classification rules using NSGA-II.
